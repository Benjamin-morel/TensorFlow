# Welcome to TensorFlow repository!
This personal code repository contains a range of artificial intelligence and numerical data processing and manipulation projects. The creation of a neural network and machine learning in Python language is made possible by the powerful TensorFlow/Keras module. Python scripts are in Jupyter notebook format, hosted and run on Google Colab. The choice of this platform was motivated by its free access to computing resources and its collaborative aspect. 

All elements of the repository are licensed under the *GNU General Public License v3.0* (see License section). 

## Why did I create this project?
The idea for this project was born at the end of my engineering degree, during my end-of-study internship. I was working on machine learning and Gaussian processes in order to make regressions and then predictions for a finite element analysis problem. Passionate about the field, I decided to learn more about the essential tools of machine learning. The idea of the TensorFlow/Keras module came after consulting job offers. 

I followed a free 2-month online training course offered by Keras (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials). I started by completing part of the training step-by-step, then merged multiple codes into one to obtain more complex and optimized neural networks. 

## What's in this code repository?

In this repository, Python scripts can be used to build and train neural networks (NN) for a wide range of applications. You'll find 5 codes:
1. **Image recognition**: basic image classification
2. **Text corpus classification**: tokenisation method to classify texts 
3. **Regression and prediction**: regression task and prediction
4. **Convolutional network**: powerful and compressed CNN that classifies images
5. **Transfert learning**: use a pre-trained model to classify images
6. **Image segmentation**: identify automatically and delineate objects
7. **Scalable model compression**: use the EPR method to compress weights in a model

## How to use it? 
It's extremely easy to use! You don't need a high-performance computer to run the codes, just a Google account. 

1. **Select the script to be executed and open it in Google Colab** (you may be asked to connect to your Google). The code opened on Google colab is a copy of the original Jupyter notebook. Feel free to modify parts of the code and/or comments.

2. **Go to the Input section to complete them**. Most neural networks have already been trained and optimized: parameters associated with each neuron have already been calculated. You can choose whether to use these parameters (complete No in this case) or train again the network (Yes).

3. **Connect to a calculation unit by clicking on *reconnect*** (a). Once connected, click on *RAM Disk* to view your machine's characteristics (b). Google Colab offers a limited but sufficient runtime. To change the execution type, click on *Modify execution type* (c). Select CPU or T4 GPU when recommended (d).

4. Finally, go to ***Run* and click on *Run all***. Once finished, browse the notebook to view the results.
